\begin{frame}{Other features not mentioned}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

  \item Noisy state and process simulation (PastaQ). AD/optimization support in progress.
  \item Time evolution with trotterization (ITensor/PastaQ). AD/optimization and TDVP support in progress.
  \item Quantum state and process tomograph (PastaQ).
  \item Predefined differentiable circuits (PastaQ).
  \item Monitered quantum circuits (PastaQ).
  \item GPU support (ITensor/PastaQ). Dense only for now, will support block sparse.
  \item Conserved quantities with multithreaded block sparse tensors (ITensor/PastaQ).
  \item More that I am probably forgetting... Ask Giacomo and me for more details.
