\begin{frame}{Future directions/in progress}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

  \item Free fermions/matchgates and conversion to tensor networks.
  \item Automatic fermions (\textbf{Miles Stoudenmire} (CCQ), \textbf{Jing  Chen} (CCQ, Zapata)).
  \item Non-abelian symmetries (\textbf{Miles Stoudenmire}).
  \item Quantum chemistry (for example UCC).
  \item Distributed computing: real space parallel circuit evolution, TDVP, and DMRG, distributed tensors, etc.
  \item Infinite MPS and tensor network tools like VUMPS and TDVP.
  \item Improved MPO compression for time evolving operators.
  \item I'm interested in building general tools and algorithms, and I'm looking for people with problems to solve. Also, we need help, code to contributions are welcome!

\end{itemize}
