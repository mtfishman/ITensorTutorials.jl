\begin{frame}{When should I use tensor networks?}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

  \item Good for many sites or qubits but limited to shorter times/circuit depths (though better with noise).
  \item Best when local gate structure or interactions match the graph structure of the tensor network.
  \item If you need very long time evolution/many layers but few qubits, use full state simulation.
    
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]

    \item ITensor and PastaQ handle this seamlessly.
    \item This is not the focus of ITensor and PastaQ at the moment, specialized libraries like \myhref{https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl}{Yao.jl} may be faster.

  \end{itemize}

  \item Tensor networks are a common, general language for reasoning about quantum many-body systems (for example, quantum circuits).

\end{itemize}
