\begin{frame}{Future directions/in progress}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

  \item More AD, make ITensor fully differentiable (have some work to do, like tensor decompositions and general network contractions, more MPS/MPO functions. You will find bugs, please contribute gradient definitions!).
  \item More general built-in tensor networks beyond MPS/MPO (tree tensor networks and PEPS, general contraction and optimization, use in circuit evolution and tomography, etc.).
  \item More HPC with multithreaded and multiprocessor parallelism and GPUs.
  \item Improved gradient optimization: higher order derivatives, preconditioners, isometrically constrained gradient optimization, etc.

\end{itemize}
