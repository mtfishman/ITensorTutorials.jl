You can build a PDF of the presentation with:
```
$ lualatex presentation
```

Note that this requires [LuaTeX](http://luatex.org/), since [Julia Mono listings](https://github.com/mossr/julia-mono-listings) requires LuaTeX.

The beamer code is based on [Tufte beamer](https://github.com/ViniciusBRodrigues/simple-tufte-beamer). Julia syntax styling makes use of the [Julia Mono font](https://juliamono.netlify.app/) and [Julia Mono listings](https://github.com/mossr/julia-mono-listings). I've included that code in this repository so the repository is self-contained.
