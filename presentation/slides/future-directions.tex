\begin{frame}{Future directions}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

  \item More AD, make ITensor fully differentiable (have some work to do, like tensor decompositions and general network contractions, more MPS/MPO functions. You will find bugs!).
  \item More general built-in tensor networks beyond MPS/MPO
  \item More HPC with multithreaded and multiprocessor parallelism and GPUs
  \item Many ongoing projects and directions: quantum chemistry (for example UCC), real space parallel DMRG, TDVP, and TEBD, MPO compression tools, general approximate contraction techniques for unstructured networks, contracting and optimizing general tensor networks with AD, infinite MPS and tensor network tools like VUMPS and TDVP, trying out different network topologies for noisy circuit tomography, simulation and optimization.
  \item Building general tools, looking for people with problems and code to contribute.
  \item Improved gradient optimization/preconditioners, isometrically constrained gradient optimization, etc.
  \item Automatic fermions, non-abelian symmetries.

\end{itemize}
