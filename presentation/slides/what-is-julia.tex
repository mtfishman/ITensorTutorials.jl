\begin{itemize}[<+->]

  \item Started in 2009, v0.1 released in 2013, v1 released in 2018.
  \item Language is very stable, ecosystem is growing very quickly.
  \item Fast like C/C++, high level features of Python, all in one language.
  \item Just-in-time compiled, garbage collected, package manager, plotting, great numerical libraries.
  \item Julia is great, you should use it.
  \item I could say more, ask me about it.
