# ITensorTutorials

This repository contains tutorials for gate evolution and optimization using ITensors.jl and PastaQ.jl.

## Tutorial

You should state in the [presentation](presentation) directory, which contains a high level summary and detailed tutorial on gate evolution and optimization in [presentation/presentation.pdf](presentation/presentation.pdf), along with code associated with the main parts of the presentation.

The presentation is split up into three primary parts:

1. One-site states and operators in ITensor ([presentation/01_one_site.jl](presentation/01_one_site.jl)).
1. Two-site states and operators in ITensor, include state and circuit optimization ([presentation/02_two_site.jl](presentation/02_two_site.jl)).
1. n-site states and operators in ITensor using MPS ([presentation/03_n_site.jl](presentation/03_n_site.jl)).

## Exercises

Exercises can be found in the [exercises](exercises) directory, which contains exercises for finding excited states with DMRG and gradient optimization.
